Iâ€™ve personally struggled with cystic acne and I know how important it is to be aware of the medicine one is using and what can be the outcome, without having to read over hundreds of reviews. 
In this personal project I worked on UCI ML medical data, which contained various reviews over different types of medicines for different conditions. 
I classified the reviews using sentiment analysis and Harvard emotional dictionary into positive or negative, on this basis I score the relevant medicine. 
The algorithm then ranks the medicine with highest rating for the condition and recommends it to the user.
